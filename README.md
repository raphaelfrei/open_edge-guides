# Open Edge - Guide
Hi! I've decided to make this guide to give some hints about programming with OpenEdge ABL (aka Progress).<br>
This is because there is no much content about progress besides the official documents. When I started learning and working with this language, most of what I learned was debugging old programs and LOTS of research.<br>
I'll try to make a basic Wiki about some essentials about progress.
