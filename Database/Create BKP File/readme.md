# Perform a Online backup from the Database
Use CMD or Progress to perform the backup.<br>
Online means that you can create the file while the DB is running.<br>

## The code submitted is a procedure, that requires three parameters:
1: .db file location. *(Full path, including DB name and omitting .db extension)* <br>
2: Folder for BKP location. <br>
3: Output LOG location. *(Text file)*

## For .BAT:
1: Change the same DB and Folder location. <br>
2: Change DLC to Progress root folder.

## How To Use:
Create a Task Scheduler to perform this backup every *x* days.<br>
Add this into your own program.<br>
